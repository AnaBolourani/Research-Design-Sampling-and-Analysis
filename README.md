# ðŸ“š Research Design Methodologies

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various research design techniques, primarily based on the UCLA STAT 201A course from the Department of Statistics. 
It includes theoretical explanations, practical examples, and homework assignments UCLA STAT 201A course to reinforce learning and covers a wide range of research design methodologies, including:

- **Basic Principles:** Understand the foundational concepts of research design, including types of studies, validity, and reliability.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Learn techniques for comparing multiple groups to identify significant differences.
- **Blocked Designs:** Explore methods to control variability by grouping similar experimental units.
- **Factorial Designs:** Investigate the effects of multiple factors simultaneously and their interactions.
- **Fractional Factorial Designs:** Implement efficient experimentation by using a subset of all possible factor combinations.
- **Response Surface Methods:** Optimize processes by modeling and analyzing relationships between variables.
- **Computer Experiments and Space-Filling Designs:** Utilize computational approaches for designing experiments that thoroughly explore the experimental space.
